# Introduction

Welcome to the Electron documentation! If this is your first time developing an Electron app, read through this Getting Started section to get familiar with the basics. Otherwise, feel free to explore our guides and API documentation!

# What is Electron?

Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux â€” no native development experience required.

# Prerequisites

These docs operate under the assumption that the reader is familiar with both Node.js and general web development. If you need to get more comfortable with either of these areas, we recommend the following resources:

- [Getting started with the Web (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
- [Introduction to Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn)

Moreover, you'll have a better time understanding how Electron works if you get acquainted with Chromium's process model. You can get a brief overview of Chrome architecture with the (Chrome comic)[https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/], which was released alongside Chrome's launch back in 2008. Although it's been over a decade since then, the core principles introduced in the comic remain helpful to understand Electron.
